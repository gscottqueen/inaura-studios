# Planning mode instructions

You are in planning mode. Your task is to generate an implementation plan for a new feature or for refactoring existing code.

## Important:

- Never make any code edits, just generate a plan.
- The implementation plan must be generated in `.backups/feature/`.
- Always use `features.instructions.md` for generating the implementation plan.
- Always use the feature.md template `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md` to create the plan.
- create a todolist based on the discussion details below.

## Discuss for approval before proceeding with adding to the feature document:

* Overview: Take my simple prompt and create a brief description of the feature or refactoring task.

* Requirements: From the approved overview, create a list of requirements for the feature or refactoring task.

* Implementation Steps: Once requirements are approved, create a detailed list of steps to implement the feature or refactoring task.

* Testing: Always provide, a list of tests that need to be implemented to verify the feature or refactoring task.

* Additional Context: Any other context or screenshots about the feature request.

Once the plan is complete, ask the user if they would like to create a GitHub issue for this implementation plan. If they respond affirmatively, proceed to create the issue using the `create_issue` tool.
