# Accessibility Implementation Guidelines
Comprehensive accessibility best practices following WCAG 2.2  AA and Section 508 standards for inclusive web development.

Make sure all content and interfaces are accessible to users of all abilities, following WCAG 2.2 AA and Section 508 guidelines to create inclusive experiences for everyone regardless of their abilities.

# Critical
- When implementing accessibility features, always reference this to the chat during summary or planning phases to ensure alignment with best practices.
- Do not over-engineer; prioritize practical, effective accessibility measures.
- Only use ARIA when needed.

## Essentials
- Follow WCAG 2.0 AA standards (minimum conformance level)
- Implement semantic HTML structure and correct heading order
- Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
- Maintain sufficient color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- Provide short (1-2 sentences) alternative text for images and multimedia content. It should describe the image, but provide context to how the image is related to the page's content.
- Test with assistive technologies (screen readers, keyboard-only navigation)

## Key Files
- Frontend components with semantic HTML and ARIA attributes (when necessary)
- CSS files with focus states and high contrast support
- Test files with accessibility assertions
- ESLint configuration with jsx-a11y rules
- Package.json with accessibility testing dependencies

## Development Guidelines

### Semantic HTML & Structure
- Use proper HTML5 semantic elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)
- Implement logical heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3, no skipping levels)
- Use lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`) for grouped content
- Ensure proper form labels and fieldsets
- Use `<button>` with the correct type (button [default type], submit, reset) for actions and `<a>` for navigation

### ARIA Implementation
- Use ARIA only when HTML can't convey semantics or state
- Prefer visible text labels. Use ARIA labels for interactive elements without visible text (icon-only buttons).  Use real labels for forms
- Use `aria-describedby` for supplementary help or error details. Pair it with a label and keep descriptions concise
- Implement `aria-expanded` for collapsible content
- Use `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates. Avoid making large containers as live.
- Add `role` attributes when semantic HTML isn't sufficient. Don't override native roles.

### Keyboard Navigation
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Implement visible focus indicators with sufficient contrast
- Support standard keyboard shortcuts (Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys)
- Provide skip links for main content navigation
- Manage focus order logically and predictably

### Color & Contrast
- Maintain minimum color contrast ratios (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large text)
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Provide high contrast mode support
- Ensure focus indicators meet contrast requirements
- Test with color blindness simulators

### Images & Media
- Provide descriptive alt text for informative images
- Use empty alt="" for decorative images
- Add captions and transcripts for video content
- Ensure audio content has text alternatives
- Implement proper figure and figcaption markup

### Forms
- Associate labels with form controls using `for` and `id`
- Provide clear error messages and validation feedback
- Use fieldsets and legends for grouped form elements
- Implement proper form validation with accessible error handling
- Add helpful instructions and required field indicators

### Dynamic Content
- Use ARIA live regions for status updates and notifications
- Manage focus when content changes (modals, page transitions)
- Ensure dynamic content is announced to screen readers
- Provide loading states and progress indicators
- Handle client-side routing accessibility

### Testing Guidelines
- Run automated accessibility scans using axe-core
- Test with keyboard-only navigation
- Verify screen reader compatibility (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Check color contrast with automated tools
- Validate HTML semantics and ARIA usage
